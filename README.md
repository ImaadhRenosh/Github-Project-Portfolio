<h2 align="left"><u>Hi, my name is Imaadh! I am an AI engineer looking to enhance the world of AI with my expertise!</u></h2>

<p align="left"><u>I am a passionate AI/ML engineer with a robust foundation in computer science, Python programming, and machine learning, driven by a relentless curiosity for innovation. Through intensive, project-based courses such as CS50, CS50 AI, and Stanford's Machine Learning Specialization (taught by AI visionary Andrew Ng), I have acquired essential skills and developed projects with strong potential to address real-world challenges. 

These projects have enabled me to gain practical expertise in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Moreover, I thrive on transforming complex data into intelligent, scalable solutions that drive tangible impact. I am continually eager to learn and adopt emerging technologies in AI and machine learning, and my goal is to join a forward-thinking tech company where I can leverage cutting-edge algorithms to solve challenging problems and help shape the future of technology.

I‚Äôm actively seeking an internship while I am in Sri Lanka, where I can contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with industry experts, and further hone my technical abilities as an aspiring ML/AI engineer. Let‚Äôs connect and create impactful solutions together.</u></p>
