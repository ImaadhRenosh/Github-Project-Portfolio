## üåü <u>Key Projects</u>

### <u>Primary Projects</u>

- **[IBM-certified Capstone Project: AI-powered Concrete Crack Detection System (Resnet-18)](https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/IBM-certified-AI-powered-Concrete-Crack-Detection-System-Capstone-Project):**  
  Developed an AI-powered system using PyTorch to detect cracks in concrete structures, which involved fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet18 model, analyzing training loss curves, and identifying misclassified samples to improve structural health monitoring, finally achieving 99.43% accuracy on the validation dataset.
- **[Game Match Win Prediction Model (League of Legends)](https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/Game-Match-Win-Prediction-Model-League-of-Legends-):**
  Developed an optimized PyTorch model via Python, to predict League of Legends match wins using 8 features (kills, deaths, assists, gold_earned, cs, wards_placed, wards_killed, damage_dealt), achieving 55.50% test accuracy (53.87% training), despite the limited predictive power of raw features 
(correlations < 0.07).
- **[Waste Image Classifier with Transfer Learning (V6616 model)](https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/Waste-Image-Classifier-with-Transfer-Learning-VGG16):**
  Developed a waste image classifier leveraging Python and TensorFlow via a VGG16 transfer learning approach with 89% accuracy, enabling better waste sorting for environmental sustainability worldwide.(IBM AI Engineering/course 3).
- **<u>Melbourne Temperature Prediction Model:</u>**
  Developed a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to forecast daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne (1981‚Äì1990) using real-world data from Jason Brownlee‚Äôs repository   
  (https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets). Parsed CSV data to create a time series, achieving an MAE of 2.1¬∞C (TensorFlow Developer Specialization, Final Project).
- **<u>Traffic Sign Classifier:</u>**
